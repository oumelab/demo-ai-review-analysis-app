# 📊 User Review Analysis App (Learning Purpose)

An AI-powered web app for analyzing and summarizing user reviews.

This app is based on the hands-on session project from [Blueberry Mojito (b13o)](https://b13o.com/), a React learning community.<br>
The code includes some modifications and enhancements made by me for personal learning purposes, such as:

- Integrating the Google Sheets API to fetch user reviews data.
- Using SWR for user review API requests.
- Adding fallback UI for loading and error states during API requests.

## 📚 Learning Purpose

This project was created as part of my personal learning journey in modern React development, API integration, and AI service utilization.  
It demonstrates basic data fetching, UI/UX considerations, and third-party API usage.
