# 📊 User Review Analysis App (Learning Purpose)

An AI-powered web app for analyzing and summarizing user reviews.

This app is based on the hands-on session project from [Blueberry Mojito](https://b13o.com/), a React learning community.<br>
The code includes some modifications and enhancements made by me for personal learning purposes, such as:

- Integrating the Google Sheets API to fetch user reviews data.
- Using SWR for user review API requests.
- Adding fallback UI for loading and error states during API requests.
